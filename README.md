# StockTracker

This is an angular app that helps you keep track of all stock prices with graphs. 
It has a very simple interface and modern UI. You will see all the need information on selected stock and it's graph on the dashboard. You can also select another stock from the stock list shown on the right.
The Second tab is stock list tab using this you can add new stocks to the list or delete the old ones. It stock lists are currently not stored on your local data so a reload will reset the list.

I am planning to add local daa storage for stock list soon.
